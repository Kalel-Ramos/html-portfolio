<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hi, im Kalel a cool guy, who loves gaming, watch movies with my wife and
  coding.

  I started at coding just for automate some things at my work with Python, but
  now its just one of my favourite things to do. I love how some lines turn out
  to systems and apps, im studying to become a Full-Stack Programmer, im started
  learning Python, when i discovered about web pages while studying i created
  some curiosity, and started to research more about coding in HTML and CSS and
  what this things can do. Now i love to code websites.
